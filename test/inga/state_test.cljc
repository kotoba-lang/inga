  "F1's acceptance criterion, stated by ADR-2608038000 as: four replicas reach
  the same CID, AND the state hydrated from that CID is queryable with
  Datalog. The second half is the whole point — same-digest was already
  achievable and was not enough.

  ## Why half of this file is written twice

  `arrangement/commit!` returns a CID on the JVM and a `js/Promise` on
  ClojureScript, and `restore` likewise. Tests that assume the synchronous
  shape PASS on the JVM and are silent about the runtime kotobase actually
  deploys on — which is the exact failure `inga.parity` exists to prevent, so
  writing these once and only running them on the JVM would have been the same
  mistake in a different file.

  Every test that touches `root-fn` or `hydrate-fn` therefore appears in both
  arms: synchronous on `:clj`, `cljs.test/async` on `:cljs`. The assertions are
  the same ones; only the awaiting differs, exactly as it does for a caller.

  Where this lands in production: `inga.replica/state-root` is REPORTING, not
  a consensus decision — no adopt or commit path reads it — so a Promise there
  is a caller's `await`, not a protocol break. That is why this split is
  liveable rather than a defect."
