  "ADR-2608038000 H1's claim, made true: what inga orders is the advance of
  agent chain heads.

  The ADR's own correction (2026-08-05) said this was design intent and not
  wiring — `:inga.block/proposals` was a vector of opaque ids and nothing
  turned a committed one into state. These tests are about the properties
  that make the bridge worth having rather than about the bridge existing: an
  agent cannot advance someone else's chain, cannot skip a link, cannot fork,
  and cannot be silently skipped when a replica lacks the body."
