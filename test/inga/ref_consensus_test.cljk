(ns inga.ref-consensus-test
  "`kotobase.storage.contract/verify` against a ref store whose CAS is decided
  by the real commit rule.

  `inga.ref-test` runs the same suite against a cooperative oracle and says so:
  an agreeable oracle is the easiest way to believe something false. This is
  the run that is evidence about agreement — four JVM threads race the same
  expected head, and what separates them is a consensus network committing
  their records in some order.

  ## What the lock is and is not doing

  The replica network is an in-process data structure, so `drive!` holds a
  lock while folding it. The lock protects the STRUCTURE. It does not decide
  the race: every thread submits into a shared pending set before any of them
  drives, all four records reach the same network, and the winner is whichever
  one the committed order puts first at that sequence. Remove the lock and you
  corrupt an atom; remove the consensus and there is no answer at all."
