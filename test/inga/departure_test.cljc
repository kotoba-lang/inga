  "What happens when a witness LEAVES.

  `replica-test` and the socket harness both test a replica that loses its
  memory — `evict!` rebuilds one in place and leaves it connected. Neither
  tests one that stops answering, and those are different failures: an evicted
  replica still takes its turn, a departed one does not.

  `my-turn?` says what happens, in its own words: *keyed by height, a dead
  leader holds its turn forever ... a protocol that tolerates one failure in
  four, not tolerating one failure in four.* This namespace turns that
  paragraph into something that runs.

  ## The gap these were written for is closed

  The first version of this namespace pinned a STALL as a characterisation
  test, because a leader that departed held its turn forever. It said to
  delete it rather than adjust it when the gap closed. It is deleted, and
  `survives-the-departure-of-the-witness-due-to-lead` says the opposite in
  its place."
