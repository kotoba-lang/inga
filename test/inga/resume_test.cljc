  "A replica that restarts must not vote twice at one height.

  These tests were written BEFORE `snapshot`/`resume` existed, because the
  failure they guard against is the one this system slashes for and it is
  invisible from the inside: a replica that votes a second time at a height it
  already voted at has equivocated, and nothing in its own state looks wrong
  afterwards. The only way to see it is to catch the second vote leaving.

  `replay` already restores `:voted` from the blocks it folds, which is why
  restarting from the WHOLE log is safe. `resume` exists so a replica does not
  have to fold the whole log — and the whole point of the bounded form is that
  it throws away the very thing `replay` was reconstructing. So the bound has
  to be replaced by something that refuses at least as much."
