  "The acceptance test for the whole point of this repo: a ref store that
  passes kotobase's OWN storage conformance suite, declaring
  `:linearizable-ref`, with no conditional write anywhere under it.

  The reference quorum below is a cooperative oracle. It models the one
  property `engi.consensus/qc` proves — at most one certificate per height —
  and nothing else. That makes this suite a check on the ADAPTER (does it
  refuse a loser, does it report the winner, does it avoid claiming a publish
  it cannot read back), NOT evidence about any real quorum's agreement. Said
  plainly because a conformance suite run against an agreeable oracle is the
  easiest possible way to believe something false."

;; COUNTING and DISTINCTNESS, which a real curve would not make any sharper.
