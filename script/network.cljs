;;
;; A BYZANTINE VALIDATOR is inside the set: w4 holds a real key and, at every
;; height it votes at, signs a SECOND vote for a block that does not exist.
;; Both signatures verify. Quorum already stops it from certifying two blocks
;; at one height — with n=4 the threshold is 3 and it is one witness — so the
;; interesting question is not whether safety holds but whether the crime is
;; recorded. An equivocator that is merely ignored pays nothing and does it
;; again next height, forever, for free.
;;
;; A FORGER dials every replica and sends votes claiming to be w2, w3 and w4
;; for a block it made up. That is the attack an unsigned vote allows, and it
;; was available until this commit: a replica assembles certificates out of
;; the votes it receives, so one connected peer could manufacture a quorum
;; without holding a key. The run asserts no honest replica certifies it.
;;
;; Prints, per replica: the height it reached, what it committed, whether
;; every replica committed the same blocks, and whether the forgery took.
;; Exits non-zero if any of that is wrong.

  "Milliseconds to hold a batch before delivering it, modelling an HTTP round
  trip between Durable Objects. `NET_DELAY=20 nbb ...` to set it.

  The sockets underneath are real and sub-millisecond, which is nothing like a
  request that has to be queued, dispatched to an isolate, handled while that
  isolate is busy with the last one, and answered. Eviction and
  transport-side signing were modelled first and neither changed the outcome;
  this is the last structural difference between here and the deployment.

  ## Re-measured 2026-08-10 — the cliff is gone

      NET_DELAY=   0   111 committed blocks   pass
      NET_DELAY=   5   166                    pass

  Throughput falls with delay, which it must: this is a round-trip-bound
  protocol and every block costs one. **Safety and liveness hold throughout**
  — all replicas agree, every forgery is refused and the equivocator is caught
  at 200ms, which covers a LAN, a tailnet and a cross-region WAN.

  This paragraph previously read *the threshold is brutally low* and recorded
  0 committed blocks at 20ms and above. That was true when it was written and
  is not true now, and leaving it would have decided a live question the wrong
  way: it says, to anyone reading, that replicas cannot be deployed as
  separate hosts over a real network — which is exactly the deployment shape
  being moved to, and it is fine. **A stale measurement is worse than no
  measurement, because it is quoted with confidence.** Re-run the table before
  citing it; the numbers are one command away and this note is what a reader
  gets instead of that command."

  3. a vote correctly signed for a DIFFERENT chain — domain separation, which
     is why chain-id is in the payload
  4. new-views carrying a certificate for a block at height 9999 that does not
     exist. The worst of these: a timeout certificate is folded out of them
     and fed straight into the lock, so quorum-many decide what every replica
     locks onto
  5. a history — a well-formed, internally consistent segment whose
     certificates simply name witnesses who never voted. Adopted as the
     replica's past until catch-up went through inga.sync
  6. a request for every block there is, which unclamped makes each replica
     serialise its whole chain to everybody"

;; Cloudflare costs a deploy, an eviction wait and a five-minute observation,

  nothing to model and had not been modelled: a deployed validator is evicted
