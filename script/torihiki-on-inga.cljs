;; The trading chain running on the consensus layer.
;;
;; Four replicas over real WebSockets, each executing torihiki.state/apply-block
;; on the blocks engi commits, and asked afterwards whether they hold the same
;; exchange: same state root, same best bid and ask, same positions.
;;
;;   nbb --classpath "src:<torihiki>/src:<bytes>/src" script/torihiki-on-inga.cljs
;;
;; ## Why this is the run that matters
;;
;; script/network.cljs proved consensus works, with a machine written for the
;; occasion — order-sensitive on purpose, but nobody's exchange. torihiki-node
;; proved the exchange works, on a single Durable Object sequencer that says
;; "consensus: none" in its own /head response. Each half was demonstrated
;; against a stand-in for the other.
;;
;; This is the join. No new engine and no new consensus: torihiki.state is
;; unchanged and inga.replica takes it through the machine seam it already
;; had, which is what that seam was for — engi does not know what a
;; transaction is, and does not learn here.
;;
;; ## Consensus says who proposed the block; it does not say who owns the money
;;
;; Applying transactions unauthenticated — which this harness did at first —
;; means a validator can put a transaction in a block on behalf of any
;; account, and every honest replica applies it, agrees on the result, and
;; produces a matching state root. Nothing looks wrong: the replicas agree
;; perfectly about somebody else spending your position.
;;
;; So transactions are signed envelopes and torihiki.auth checks them inside
;; apply-block, where the nonce and the key binding are consensus state rather
;; than server state. A Byzantine LEADER is in the set for exactly this: w4
;; injects an order as account 1, signed with its own key, into every block it
;; proposes.
;;
;; ## The thief won the first time, and the run said pass
;;
;; torihiki binds an account id to the first public key that authenticates for
;; it. Under a single sequencer the owner is always first. Under BFT the
;; Byzantine LEADER proposes blocks, so if the account is unbound it claims
;; the id — and then the genuine owner is refused :wrong-key on every
;; transaction, forever, on their own account.
;;
;; That is what happened: account 1 ended at -50, exactly the thief's order,
;; while 34 of the owner's transactions were refused. The run reported PASS,
;; because it checked that refusals existed and not WHOSE they were.
;;
;; The fix is in torihiki now, not worked around here: a key may only bind the
;; id DERIVED FROM IT, so there is nothing to race for. The thief can claim
;; ids belonging to its own key and no others, and it does not hold the key
;; for any account that has collateral.
