  "F1 — the committed state root as a real CID, not an opaque digest.

  ## What was wrong

  A consensus machine seam that returns `(root-fn state) -> \"113:c51298e1\"`
  lets replicas COMPARE state and nothing else. They cannot sync it, query
  it, serve it, or prove anything about it, and a caller downstream cannot
  point a ref at it. Agreement on a digest is agreement that two processes
  computed the same number — which is necessary and nowhere near sufficient
  for the thing this stack sells, which is a queryable database.

  Filecoin's answer is that on-chain state IS an IPLD structure (a HAMT of
  address -> actor), so a state root is a CID you can walk. FEVM maps
  `SLOAD`/`SSTORE` onto that rather than onto a Merkle-Patricia Trie, and
  pays exactly one method for it (`eth_getProof`). Superproject
  ADR-2608038000 F1 takes the same shape and explicitly does NOT introduce a
  HAMT, because this workspace already has three content-addressed maps.

  ## So this namespace composes rather than invents

  `kotoba-lang/arrangement` already snapshots a 4-index datom db into
  prolly-trees and CID-addresses the commit itself (dag-cbor of
  `{schema-version index-roots prev}`, every root a real tag-42 IPLD link),
  returns the commit CID, and restores from it. `arrangement.datalog/q`
  already queries it. None of that is rewritten here.

  What this namespace adds is the SEAM and one enforced distinction:

  ## `:root-kind` — the distinction that makes ADR-2608038000 D6 checkable

  A machine declares `:root-kind`:

    `:cid`     the root is a content-addressed commit that `hydrate` can
               restore and `arrangement.datalog/q` can query.
    `:opaque`  the root is a digest. Replicas can compare it. Nothing else.

  `:opaque` stays legal — a machine whose state is a typed-array order book
  is not obliged to become datoms to reach consensus. What is NOT legal is
  wiring an `:opaque` machine to kotobase's ref plane, because a kotobase
  ref must point at something hydratable. `assert-hydratable!` is that gate,
  and it exists so the ordering constraint in D6 is enforced by code instead
  of remembered by a reader.

  ## Platform split — `root-fn` and `hydrate-fn` are async on ClojureScript

  `arrangement/commit!` returns the commit CID DIRECTLY on the JVM and a
  `js/Promise` of it on ClojureScript, and `restore` likewise. That split is
  arrangement's, not something introduced here, and it is not hidden: the
  runtime kotobase actually deploys on is a Cloudflare Worker, so the
  Promise path is the important one and a caller that treats the return as a
  string will get `#object[Promise]` in its state root and agree with nobody.

  The split is not only in the return value: on cljs, arrangement also expects
  `blind-fn` / `encrypt-fn` / `decrypt-fn` to RETURN Promises. Passing the
  JVM-shaped synchronous seams fails inside arrangement with `.then is not a
  function`, and only the cljs build says so.

  `inga.head`, `inga.ref`, `inga.fuel` and `inga.power` are pure and
  synchronous on both runtimes — `inga.parity` runs them on JVM and nbb and
  checks one digest. `inga.state` is the namespace where the split lives, and
  it is covered by the shadow-cljs suite instead (`npm run test:cljs`), which
  runs the same 247 tests the JVM does. nbb cannot host it: SCI raises
  `Protocol not found: IEquiv` inside a transitive dependency.

  Where the split lands in production: `inga.replica/state-root` is REPORTING
  — no adopt or commit path reads it — so a Promise there is a caller's
  `await`, not a protocol break.

  ## Fuel

  When `:fuel` is supplied, ops are metered by `inga.fuel` and the outcome is
  written into the db AS DATOMS, not hung off the state map. This is not a
  stylistic choice: `root-fn` commits `(:db state)`, so a fuel ledger kept
  anywhere else would not be covered by the root, and two replicas that
  stopped at different ops could still produce identical CIDs. Recording it
  as datoms makes exhaustion change the root, which is the only version of
  this that a peer can check.

  ## Two roots (superproject ADR-2608059000)

  The state root is now a node with TWO children, not one:

      StateRoot = {schema-version, actors, datoms, prev}
                                   |       |
                     actor tree ---+       +--- arrangement commit
                     address -> {code,          {schema-version,
                     state, nonce, balance}      index-roots{spo pso pos ocp},
                                                 prev}

  and the direction between them is the decision, not the shape: **the actor
  tree is the source, the datom indices are a committed projection of it.**

  Why they are SIBLINGS rather than one inside the other. An actor tree
  partitions state by actor. Put the datoms inside an actor's subtree and
  `pos` (\"which entity has attribute A = value V\") and `ocp` (reverse
  references) stop being global — answering either would mean scanning every
  actor, which is superproject ADR-260726's one-ref rule broken, and the same
  failure the sekaiju shard split produced. Keeping the indices at the same
  height as the actor tree is the entire condition; meet it and the actor
  layer costs the query plane nothing.

  What the actor tree buys that datoms alone did not: a place to enforce
  \"only this actor may write here\" structurally, `code` as the CID of a
  checked definition (`codebase/typed-code`), and somewhere for `nonce` and
  `balance` to live.

  `\"datoms\"` links arrangement's COMMIT, not its four index roots directly.
  ADR-2608059000's figure draws that child as `index-roots`; linking the
  commit is the faithful implementation of it, because the commit is what
  `arrangement/restore` takes, and reimplementing its envelope here would be
  two encodings of one thing.

  ## Emission has to be a pure function of the transition

  `:emit-fn` is `(fn [actor-op prev-actor next-actor] -> [datom-op …])` and it
  runs inside the same `apply-op` call as the mutation, so a source change and
  its projection cannot land in different blocks. It is also **charged for**:
  an actor op costs `cost-fn` for itself plus `cost-fn` over every datom it
  projects, as ONE unit. Both halves matter and for the same reason —
  a block that ran out of fuel between a mutation and its projection would
  commit a state whose index disagrees with its source, and no peer could tell
  that apart from an honest one.

  What the network enforces, rather than what this docstring asks for: the
  projection is inside the state root, so an `emit-fn` that reads anything
  outside `[op prev next]` makes replicas produce different roots from the same
  block. `emission-is-deterministic-or-replicas-split` demonstrates exactly
  that, and shows the split lands in the `datoms` child while the `actors`
  child stays identical.

  ## Only this actor may write here (ADR-2608059000 step 4)

  The ADR's reason for putting the actor tree under the datom indices was that
  it is \"a place to enforce 'only this actor may write here' structurally\".
  `:authority` is that enforcement: with it configured, every actor op must
  name an author and `:actor-put`/`:actor-delete` may only write the author's
  own address. A refused op changes neither root and is COUNTED, per block and
  per reason, in the db — so a peer that refused a different set of ops
  reaches a different state root rather than agreeing while having applied
  something else.

  **What it does not establish is WHO authored an op.** Ops arrive from
  `decode-block`, the application's own reading of a committed block, and only
  the application holds the signature that block carried. This namespace
  enforces the rule given an author; it cannot check the claim. That is the
  same seam `engi.replica` draws and for the same reason, and it is stated
  here rather than implied because a reader could otherwise take the check for
  authentication.

  ## `code` is a CID that runs

  An actor's `code` was a link the tree carried and nothing read. `:invoke-fn`
  is the seam that runs it: an `:actor-call` op resolves the callee's current
  `code` and own-`state`, hands them to the seam with the caller and the
  block's fuel price, and writes back the state root it returns — and nothing
  else. `balance` is untouched because there is no fee model to move it with,
  `nonce` because its FVM meaning is the SENDER's counter and this caller need
  not be an actor at all, and `code` because an actor rewriting its own code
  mid-call is a decision nobody has made.

  The seam is where `kotoba-lang/codebase` binds in: `evaluator/invoke` runs a
  definition from its hash alone, hydrating every dependency by CID, and that
  is exactly an actor code loader. inga does not depend on it — the contract
  between them is a function shape, the same way `verify-fn` and `sign-fn` are
  injected rather than imported.

  ## What is still NOT closed

  - **Emission is opt-in.** Supply `default-emit` (or your own) and the
    projection tracks the source; supply nothing and the two roots are
    independent trees. Making it mandatory is a policy decision, not a
    mechanism one, and nothing here forces it.
  - **Emission is not written in `.kotoba`.** ADR-2608059000's step 3 asks for
    that and it is not possible today: measured 2026-08-05 against
    `kotoba compile --target wasm`, a vector literal lowers and `defrecord`
    lowers, but `count` and `nth` over a vector have **no admitted lowering**
    (`:phase :subset`). A module can therefore BUILD the vector of datom ops
    emission returns and nothing can consume it. That is the same wall
    `kotoba/fuel.kotoba` documents from the other side when it says it keeps
    to the scalar subset rather than returning a pair.
  - **`:prev` advances nowhere.** `init-fn` seeds it nil and no path writes
    it, so every StateRoot so far carries a null `prev`. That was already
    true before two roots (it was passed to `arrangement/commit!` and was
    always nil); what moved is only which node the chain belongs to.
  - **Authority is opt-in, and so is what it rests on.** Omit `:authority` and
    any op writes any address, exactly as before. Configure it and the rule
    holds only as far as `decode-block` reports a verified author (above).
  - **A call pays its limit, not its usage.** With `:fuel` on, an
    `:actor-call` is charged `cost-fn`'s price for the op and the seam is
    handed that same number as its budget. Refunding the unspent remainder
    would make an op's cost depend on running it, and `apply-metered` charges
    before it steps precisely so `spent` can never exceed `budget`.
  - **An op dropped for want of fuel may already have run.** The accountant
    prices an op before charging it, and pricing an `:actor-call` means
    executing it. The execution is discarded with the op — no state moves —
    but the work was done.
  - **A missing `:address` still throws rather than refusing.** It predates
    this namespace's refusal path and is left alone here; adversarial input
    that is malformed rather than unauthorized deserves the same treatment,
    and does not have it yet.

(defn machine
  "A consensus machine whose root is a real CID.

  `decode-block` is `(fn [block] -> [{:op :assert|:retract :s _ :p _ :o _} …])`
  — the application's own reading of what a committed block means. inga does
  not learn what a transaction is (the seam `engi.replica` already draws, for
  the reason its own ADR-2608022500 gives: a consensus layer that imports one
  application becomes that application's consensus layer).

  `put!` is prolly-tree shaped `(fn [cid bytes])`. `blind-fn`/`encrypt-fn`
  are arrangement's required keyed-MAC and AEAD seams — required there
  precisely so nobody gets an unblinded index by forgetting an argument, and
  passed straight through here.

  `:fuel` is optional `{:budget-fn (fn [block] -> int) :cost-fn (fn [op] -> int)
  :height-fn (fn [block] -> int)}`. Seams are checked with `ifn?` rather than
  `fn?` throughout: a keyword is a perfectly good accessor (`:height-fn
  :height`) and rejecting one would be a restriction with no safety behind it
  — what the check is for is catching a seam that was forgotten, and `nil` is
  not `ifn?` either way. `:height-fn` is required alongside the
  others because a fuel record without the height it happened at is a fact
  nobody can locate in the chain.

  `:emit-fn` is optional `(fn [actor-op prev-actor next-actor] -> [datom-op …])`
  — the projection from the actor tree (source) to the datom indices. It runs
  inside the same `apply-op` call as the actor mutation, so a source change and
  its projection cannot land in different blocks. `default-emit` is a ready
  policy; omitting it leaves the two roots independent, which is legal and is
  what ADR-2608059000's step 3 closes.

  `:authority` is optional `{:caller-fn (fn [op] -> address-or-nil)}`,
  defaulting to `:caller` — ADR-2608059000 step 4. Supplied, every actor op
  must name an author, and `:actor-put`/`:actor-delete` may only write the
  author's OWN address. Omitted, any op may write any address, which is what
  every deployment before this did.

  `:invoke-fn` is optional
  `(fn [{:keys [address caller code state method args fuel]}]
     -> {:state cid-or-nil} | {:refused reason})`
  — what makes an actor's `code` a CID that RUNS rather than a CID that is
  merely stored. It is handed the callee's current own-state root and returns
  the next one; the applier writes that and nothing else.

  Three properties it MUST have, none of which this namespace can check:

  - **Pure.** A function of its argument alone. Two replicas that disagree
    produce different actor trees from the same block, which is the same
    failure `emission-is-deterministic-or-replicas-split` demonstrates for
    emission, in the other root.
  - **Total.** It returns `{:refused …}` where it cannot proceed; it does not
    throw. A replica that throws has left the protocol (see `inga.fuel`), and
    running untrusted code is exactly where a throw is easiest to provoke.
  - **Bounded.** With `:fuel` configured it receives the block's price for
    that op as `:fuel` and must not exceed it.

  `:height-fn` is `(fn [block] -> int)` and is REQUIRED alongside `:authority`
  or `:invoke-fn`, for the same reason `:fuel` requires its own: a refusal
  nobody can locate in the chain is not a record. Pass the same function
  twice if you configure both — `:fuel`'s own is unchanged, so no existing
  caller moves.

  Ops are `{:op :assert|:retract :s _ :p _ :o _}` for datoms and
  `{:op :actor-put :address _ :actor {…}}` / `{:op :actor-delete :address _}`
  / `{:op :actor-call :address _ :method _ :args _}` for actors. Actor ops are
  DATA, not functions: a block has to decode to the same ops on every replica,
  and a closure does not travel. That is also why a call names a `:method` and
  carries `:args` rather than carrying code — the code is already in the tree,
  addressed by hash.

  Returns `{:init-fn :apply-fn :root-fn :root-kind :hydrate-fn}`. The first
  three are the shape the replica already takes."
