  "The head record a quorum certifies — `kotobase.head/v1` with the issuer
  signature replaced by a quorum certificate.

  ## Why the record shape barely changes

  `kotobase.storage.signed-head` already made the head a SIGNED, SEQUENCED
  record stored as an ordinary immutable block, and its docstring is precise
  about the one thing that buys and the one thing it does not:

      What that buys: fork DETECTION, untrusted hosting, and the loser
      learning it lost.
      What it does NOT buy: AGREEMENT. A signature proves who issued a head,
      not that no one else issued another. So the declared profile is
      `:single-writer-ref`, and a correct deployment still puts one writer in
      front of it — a Durable Object, an actor, a lease.

  inga replaces that one writer with a quorum. Everything else about the
  record was already right, so `head-record` here is `kotobase.head/v1`'s
  field-for-field with `issuer`/`sig` widened to `cert`. A reader that walks
  `prev` and checks `seq` monotonicity does not have to learn a second
  format.

  ## What a certificate has to prove, and what it does not

  A certificate proves that `quorum` DISTINCT witnesses of a known validator
  set signed exactly this record at exactly this sequence. That is the whole
  claim. It does NOT prove the witnesses were honest, that the validator set
  is well chosen, or that the operator running them is plural — those are
  deployment properties, and ADR-2607110300's labelling rule applies: while
  every witness is under one operator this is crash fault tolerance, not
  Byzantine fault tolerance, and it is named that way.

  Verification here is deliberately dumb and total: shape, version, sequence,
  distinctness, threshold, then every signature. It rejects rather than
  throws, because an untrusted host is expected to be able to serve rubbish
  and the caller's job is to not believe it — the same stance
  `kotobase.storage.signed-head/verify-chain` takes.

  No I/O, no crypto, no clock. `verify-fn` is injected exactly the way
  `signed-head` injects it and `engi.consensus` injects `hash-fn`."

  `nil` renders as the empty string, which is unambiguous here because every
  field is either a fixed-width integer or a CID string, and a CID is never
  empty. Genesis is `prev=`, not `prev=nil`."

  `verify-fn` is `(fn [bytes sig witness] -> boolean)`. `quorum` is the
  threshold this validator set requires; the caller derives it (for a BFT set
  that is `engi.consensus/quorum-size`, 2f+1 of n=3f+1) rather than this ns
  guessing, because a wrong threshold is a silent safety failure and the
  arithmetic belongs with the set that knows n.

  `admitted?` is `(fn [witness] -> boolean)` — **who is even allowed to
  count.** A set works directly, because a set is that function.

  ## Why this is required and not optional

  This namespace's own docstring says a certificate proves that quorum
  distinct witnesses *of a known validator set* signed the record. Until
  2026-08-05 nothing here knew the set. Membership was left to `verify-fn`,
  and the obvious `verify-fn` — verify this Ed25519 signature — does not
  check it: an attacker generates `quorum` keypairs, signs the record with
  every one of them, and the certificate verifies. Nothing is forged. The
  claim in the docstring was simply not enforced anywhere.

  The asymmetry was the tell: `quorum` was an argument and checked here,
  while membership was a property no argument carried. Superproject
  ADR-2608047000 follow-up 4 named it and deliberately did not add it as an
  optional parameter with a permissive default, because a security check that
  defaults to off is a security check most callers do not have. It is
  required, exactly like `quorum`, and every caller updates.

  ## Order matters

  Membership is applied BEFORE the threshold, so signatures from outside the
  set cannot count toward it — the same discipline as checking `ref-name`
  before the signature: a check that runs after the decision is not a check."

(defn verify-head
  "A head map from storage, verified as the head OF `ref-name`, or nil.

  A head that fails verification is treated as ABSENT rather than as an
  error. That is not leniency: the block plane is content-addressed and safe
  on any host, so the only thing an untrusted or broken ref host can do is
  serve a record that does not verify, and the correct reading of that is
  `there is no head here` — which a caller already knows how to handle.

  **`ref-name` is checked, not merely required to be present.** Until
  2026-08-04 this took no ref name at all: it asserted `\"ref\"` was
  non-blank and never compared it to the ref actually being read. `\"ref\"`
  is inside the certified record, so a head for ref A carries a perfectly
  good certificate — and the dumb `read-head!` this store is built on is
  explicitly allowed to be an untrusted host. That host could answer a read
  for ref B with ref A's real head and every replica would agree it verifies:
  the reader gets A's CID under B, with nothing forged and nothing to detect.
  Same finding and same fix as `kotobase.storage.signed-head` (superproject
  ADR-2608047000); the quorum does not change it, because a certificate
  proves the witnesses signed THAT record, not that the record answers THIS
  question.

  `admitted?` is passed straight to `verify-cert` — see there for why a
  certificate that does not know its validator set proves nothing."
