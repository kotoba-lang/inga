  "F3's last piece: crediting `:storage` power by asking a witness to produce
  blocks it claims to hold.

  ## Why this is cheap here and expensive in Filecoin

  Filecoin needs PoRep and PoSt because a storage proof there has to survive
  an adversary who can fetch the data from anywhere and who is paid to appear
  to store it. Those proofs are enormous machinery.

  A datom plane needs much less for a much weaker claim, because **the data is
  content-addressed**. Asking \"return the bytes for this CID\" has an answer
  that verifies itself: hash what came back and compare. There is no trusted
  party, no setup, no sector, and no proving time. The whole verifier is one
  hash and one comparison.

  ## What a passing sample proves, and the three things it does not

  It proves: **at sample time, this witness could produce these bytes.**

  It does NOT prove
  1. **durable storage.** A witness that fetched the block from a peer the
     moment it was asked passes. Nothing here distinguishes holding from
     fetching.
  2. **unique storage.** Ten witnesses can pass on one physical copy.
  3. **future availability.** The sample is about the instant it ran.

  The economic argument against (1) is that fetching on demand costs more than
  storing when samples are frequent and unpredictable enough — and that is an
  ARGUMENT, not a measurement, so no deployment using this may claim
  Filecoin-equivalent storage guarantees. Superproject ADR-2608038000 F3 says
  the same in one line; this says it where someone is about to rely on it.

  ## Unpredictable, and verifiable that it was unpredictable

  A witness that can predict its challenge stores only what will be asked for.
  So the challenge is derived from a value fixed AFTER the witness's storage
  claim and by nobody in particular — a committed block hash — through an
  injected `hash-fn`. Deriving it from wall-clock time or a caller's choice
  would let the caller pick a witness's fate, which is the same hole from the
  other side.

  Pure: no I/O, no crypto, no clock. `hash-fn` and `cid-of` are injected, the
  same seam every other namespace here uses."

  Reads the LAST `hex-tail` characters rather than the first: some hash
  encodings carry a fixed prefix (a multihash header, a version byte), and an

  input — which looks like a working selector and samples one block forever."

  from the same claim.

  claims fewer, and an empty challenge when it claims none — a witness with
  nothing to prove is not thereby proven."

  `responses` is `{cid bytes}`. `cid-of` is `(fn [bytes] -> cid-string)` —

  CIDs its own way would be checking a different question than the one the
  store answers.

  Returns `{:witness :passed :failed :verdict}`. A response whose bytes hash
  to a DIFFERENT cid counts as failed rather than missing, and the difference
  matters: missing is 'I do not have it', wrong is 'I gave you something
  else', and only the second is evidence of anything but absence."
