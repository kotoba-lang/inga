(ns inga.reservation
  "One-shot reservation evidence, distinct from commitment membership.

  The slot is [chain-id ref seq=0]. Its winning CID must content-address a
  consumer's holder, request id, and exact intent. This verifier establishes
  only the first finalized CID, NOT that its presenter owns a signing key,
  nor that two workers sharing that key cannot both send. There is no TTL,
  release, epoch rollover, or reassignment. Downstream consumption/fencing
  and authenticated intent resolution remain mandatory before external IO.

  Proof is a COMPLETE prefix from trusted empty genesis, plus a tip QC.
  This deliberately costs O(history); a bounded tail/membership proof cannot
  prove absence of an earlier winner. A state-root/checkpoint proof is the
  future scalable replacement. No production cutover on this verifier alone.

  Safety assumes the configured static validator set respects the replica
  voting/locking protocol, quorum fault bound, durable votes before send,
  no key clones or rollback, and collision-resistant canonical block hashes.
  Signatures cannot prove those operational assumptions. A quorum that
  equivocates can certify conflicting histories; this API does not hide it."
