(ns inga.propose
  "The host half of `propose!`: submit a head record, wait for the committed
  prefix to decide it, and report the outcome `inga.ref` needs.

  `inga.ref`'s own comment says what this is and why it is not per-deployment:

      submit the record  →  await the block that carries it  →  (outcome …)

      and nothing about that sequence should be re-derived per deployment.

  The pure half — `project`, `head-of`, `outcome` — already lives in
  `inga.ref`. This is the loop around it.

  ## The distinction `outcome` alone cannot make

  `inga.ref/outcome` answers *did this record win its sequence*, and its
  `(nil? winner)` branch returns `{:certified? false}` — nobody holds the
  sequence, so the record did not win it.

  That is the right TERMINAL answer and the wrong POLL answer. A proposal is
  submitted before it is committed, so on the first poll nobody holds the
  sequence yet and `outcome` says the writer lost. A loop built on `outcome`
  directly reports failure for every proposal, including every successful
  one — and it would do it while looking entirely correct, because each
  individual call is returning exactly what it documents.

  So `step` distinguishes them: `:inga.propose/pending` while the sequence is
  unclaimed, and the decision only once somebody holds it. `outcome` is
  unchanged and is still what produces the decision — this namespace does not
  re-decide anything, it decides WHEN to ask.

  ## Timing out is reported as a loss, on purpose

  A proposal that has not been decided by the deadline may still commit
  afterwards. Reporting `{:certified? false}` can therefore be WRONG in one
  direction only: the writer is told it lost a race it went on to win.

  That is the safe direction and the same one `inga.ref` already argues for
  its read-back check: a false negative sends the caller back to re-read the
  head, where it finds its own record and proceeds. The opposite error —
  claiming a publish that is not readable — is the one with no safe recovery.
  `:timed-out?` is set so a caller that wants to distinguish them can, and so
  the case is visible in metrics rather than indistinguishable from a genuine
  loss.

  ## Seams

    submit!    (fn [record] -> ignored)   hand the record to the consensus
    committed  (fn [] -> records)         head records in committed order
    now-ms     (fn [] -> int)             injected, so tests own the clock
    sleep!     (fn [ms] -> ignored)       JVM only; cljs uses a timer

  No I/O, no crypto, no wall-clock of its own — the same stance every other
  namespace here takes."
