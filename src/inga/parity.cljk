  "One scenario over the pure namespaces, run on both runtimes, printing one
  digest.

      clojure -M:parity
      nbb --classpath src -e \"(require '[inga.parity :as p]) (p/report)\"

  Both must print the same line.

  ## Why this exists

  A JVM suite is not evidence about ClojureScript, and ClojureScript is the
  runtime that matters here — kotobase deploys on Cloudflare Workers. engi
  wrote the same namespace for the same reason and its docstring names the
  incident: a JVM-side optimisation broke torihiki's cljs path completely
  while every test stayed green.

  ## What it covers, and the one thing it cannot

  Covered: `inga.head` (canonical bytes, certificate counting and
  distinctness), `inga.fuel` (metering and the exhaustion point),
  `inga.power` (the table as a function of an event sequence), and
  `inga.ref`'s CAS decision over an in-memory head store. All pure, all
  synchronous on both runtimes.

  Also covered, lifted verbatim from `engi.parity` when those namespaces moved
  here: `inga.consensus`, `inga.pacemaker`, `inga.quorum`, `inga.sync` and a
  real `inga.wire` encode/decode round trip. Merged into ONE digest rather than
  kept as a second entry point — two parity commands is one command someone
  forgets.

  NOT covered: `inga.state`. `arrangement/commit!` returns a CID on the JVM
  and a `js/Promise` on cljs, so there is no single synchronous digest to
  compare — the platform split is real and is documented in
  `inga.state`'s docstring rather than papered over here. Verifying the cljs
  path of `inga.state` needs arrangement's own cljs deps and is a separate
  piece of work, named in the README as open."
