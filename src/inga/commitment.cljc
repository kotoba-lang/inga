(ns inga.commitment
  "A head record proved by the consensus that actually ran, rather than by a
  second signature over the record.

  ## Why this namespace exists

  `inga.ref` asks `inga.head/verify-cert` for a certificate whose signatures
  cover `head/canonical-bytes` of the head record. `inga`'s witnesses sign
  `inga.attest/vote-payload` — chain, view, height, **block hash**, witness.
  Those are different byte strings, so no placement of a quorum certificate
  satisfies that verifier, and until this namespace the only thing that ever
  implemented `propose!` was a cooperative oracle in the tests. Superproject
  ADR-2608198200 records the measurement.

  There were three ways out. Have the witnesses sign each head record as
  well, which asks the quorum a question consensus already answered and puts
  a second round trip in front of every ref write. Trust the witness you read
  from, which discards the one property `inga.ref` exists for. Or prove
  **membership**: this record is in this block, and this block carries a
  quorum certificate. That is what is here.

  ## Where it does NOT live

  Not in `inga.head`, which would leave one namespace owning two proof models
  and no way to tell from a call site which one a deployment relies on. Not
  in `inga.ref`, which is an adapter and would then contain the verification
  it is supposed to be given. The head-record certificate is untouched: a
  deployment that has witnesses sign head records keeps working exactly as
  before, and nothing here weakens it.

  ## Seams

                                                    reason as `inga.state`'s

(defn verify-commitment
  "The reason `record` is NOT proved committed, or nil when it is.

  Three checks and every one of them is load-bearing. Stated as the attack
  each removes, because a check whose purpose is not written down is a check
  someone reorders:

  - **`:block-not-certified`** — the certificate names a block hash and it is
    not this block's. Without it, a real certificate for block X plus an
    attacker's block Y containing an attacker's record verifies: nothing is
    forged and the record is not committed.
  - **`:certificate-invalid`** — `attest/verify-certificate`, which is where
    membership, signatures and quorum are decided. Without it a certificate
    is whatever its holder says.
  - **`:not-in-block`** — the record is among the block's proposals. Without
    it, any record at all rides on a legitimately committed block.

  The binding is checked BEFORE the signatures, the same ordering discipline
  `verify-certificate` uses for membership and `verify-head` uses for the ref
  name: a check that runs after the decision is not a check. Here it also
  costs less, since a mismatched hash is an equality and a certificate is N
  signature verifications.

  Returns a keyword rather than false so an operator can tell a broken
  deployment from a rejected record — the same reason `netmap/denials`
  exists on the other side of this stack."
