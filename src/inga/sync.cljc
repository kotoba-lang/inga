  "Catch-up: what a replica that has been away may accept from a peer.

  `inga.pacemaker` lets a lagging replica jump forward a view at a time on a
  timeout certificate. It does not give it the BLOCKS it missed, and a replica
  without them cannot check that a new proposal extends anything, so it cannot
  safely vote. Catching up is what turns 'I know I am behind' into 'I am not'.

  ## Sync is the easiest place to rewrite history, so it is the strictest

  Everything else in this protocol is fed by the replica's own observations.
  Sync is the one path where a replica takes a sequence of blocks from a
  stranger and adds it to what it believes. If that path is loose, none of the
  safety work upstream matters — an attacker does not need to break the commit
  rule if it can simply hand you a different past.

  So a segment is accepted only when every one of these holds:

  1. It ATTACHES to a block the replica already has. A segment that starts
     from nothing is a fabricated history, however well-formed.
  2. Heights are contiguous and ascending. A gap is a place to hide a block.
  3. Every block is justified by a quorum certificate for ITS OWN PARENT —
     the same `direct-extends?` check `inga.consensus` uses, so sync cannot
     accept a chain the commit rule would reject.
  4. Every certificate carries a quorum of DISTINCT witnesses, and — when a
     verifier is supplied — a quorum that actually SIGNED. Counting names
     alone was a real hole: a certificate inside a block from a stranger was
     never seen by this replica as votes, so `inga.consensus/qc`'s
     \"already verified by the caller\" contract could not hold here, and a
     peer could list three witnesses who never voted.
  5. The segment is bounded. An unbounded one is a memory attack that needs no
     invalid data at all.

  A segment that fails any of them is rejected WHOLE. Adopting the valid
  prefix of a bad segment would let a peer choose where the replica's history
  ends by appending garbage.

  ## What this namespace does not do

  It does not fetch anything, and it does not own the crypto: `inga.attest`
  holds the payload and the check, and the verifier itself is injected — a
  browser that cannot re-verify a certificate is not a verifier. It decides
  what to ask for and what may be believed."
