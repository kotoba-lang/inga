(ns inga.stake
  "Permissionless witness admission via external-collateral bonding, plus
  equivocation-only slashing (ADR-2607994000). Pure: no I/O, no crypto, no
  wall-clock — bond-balance verification and signature checking are both
  injected by the caller, same seam `inga.core/fold-balance` already uses
  for its optional `:hash-fn`.

  Bond asset is EXTERNAL COLLATERAL (e.g. USDC on Base L2 — reusing
  ADR-2607101100 §4's existing off-ramp boundary), deliberately NOT EN
  itself: EN nets to zero across all agents (mutual credit, not a scarce
  token), so bonding EN would give zero real economic disincentive against
  misbehavior. This ns is agnostic to WHICH external asset/chain custodies
  the bond — it just consumes an already-verified `{witness-did ->
  {:amount N :roles #{...}}}` map; wiring that map to a real escrow
  contract is out of scope here (ADR-2607994000 Decision #1).

  Bond records carry a `:roles` set (ADR-2607995000 §5 — the unified
  witness market): `:ordering` (engi/L1 block-consensus voting, this ns's
  own domain) and/or `:recompute` (proof-of-compute sample recompute, a
  different ns/domain entirely — cloud-murakumo's `verify/compute.cljc`).
  ONE bond market, self-selected roles, instead of two separate staking
  markets for two physically-different node populations (Mac-mini-class
  ordering witnesses vs. GPU-class recompute witnesses) — bond, unbond
  delay, slashing, and governance are all shared; only which duty a
  witness is eligible for differs. Role-filtering happens entirely in
  `eligible-witnesses`'s 3-arity and `eligible-for-role` — every other fn
  here (`stake-qc`, `slash`, ...) is role-agnostic: it just operates on
  whatever witness coll/bond-record the caller already filtered by role.

  The bond FLOOR, however, is role-ASYMMETRIC as of 2026-07-25 (see the
  `required-bond` / `eligible-for-role` / `quorum-met?` section below): one
  market and one rulebook, but the amount of collateral a role must post is
  sized to what that role actually guards, and for `:ordering` the protocol
  cannot compute that without pricing EN — which it must not do.

  Admission (`eligible-witnesses`) is permissionless: meeting the bond
  threshold is the ONLY requirement, no existing-witness vote. Quorum
  (`stake-quorum-met?`/`stake-qc`) is STAKE-weighted, not witness-count —
  the same >2/3-of-total-stake rule real PoS BFT systems use, and the thing
  that actually resists Sybil once anyone can mint arbitrarily many witness
  identities by splitting collateral across many small bonds: splitting
  a fixed amount of stake into more identities changes nothing about the
  SUM those identities can vote with (see consensus_test.cljc-style tests
  for the concrete demonstration).

  Slashing is scoped to EQUIVOCATION ONLY — the one fault category that's
  cryptographically unambiguous (two signed votes, same witness key, same
  height, different block-hash). Liveness/censorship faults are
  deliberately NOT slashable here (`liveness-drop` only removes a witness
  from the next epoch's active set, no bond forfeiture) because they
  cannot be distinguished from honest network failure without a subjective
  judgment call — and avoiding that judgment call is what lets this design
  skip building a slashing-dispute/appeal system entirely (ADR-2607994000
  Decision #5).")

;; ── role-asymmetric bond requirement (2026-07-25) ───────────────────────────
;;
;; ADR-2607995000 §5 unified the two witness markets into ONE bond market with
;; role tags, and that stands. What did NOT hold up is applying the SAME bond
;; FLOOR to both roles, because the two roles do not guard the same value:
;;
;;   :recompute — a buyer paid real USDC for an inference and a witness attests
;;                it was computed honestly. The value at risk is denominated in
;;                the bond asset already, and it exists from the first paid
;;                request. A fixed floor is straightforwardly correct here.
;;
;;   :ordering  — a witness attests the order of EN transfers. EN is non-priced,
;;                non-redeemable and convertible to nothing (ADR-2607995000 §1
;;                membrane rules), so the protocol CANNOT compute what a
;;                successful equivocation is worth without putting an external
;;                price on EN — which is precisely the back door §3 of that same
;;                ADR closed when it repealed per-transfer external-asset fees.
;;
;; Note carefully what this does and does not claim. It is NOT that equivocating
;; on EN ordering is harmless: a counterparty who hands over real goods for
;; double-spent EN loses something real. It is that the loss is the
;; COUNTERPARTY'S OWN valuation of those goods, which is private, unpriced, and
;; unavailable to the protocol. So the ordering floor cannot be derived by
;; formula and is a GOVERNANCE PARAMETER (stake-weighted 2/3, ADR-2607994000
;; Decision #8) — with a bootstrap value of 0 and an objective trigger for
;; revisiting it, rather than a number invented to look prudent.
;;
;; The trigger is now measurable, which it was not before today: the first EN
;; transfer between two agents where neither is the operator. `inga.metrics`
;; reports exactly that (:external-counterparties), so "when do we set a real
;; ordering bond?" has a checkable answer instead of a judgement call.
;;
;; The honest cost of a 0 floor is stated, not buried: an unbonded witness set
;; has NO Sybil resistance. `quorum-met?` below therefore refuses to launder
;; that into something that looks like BFT security — it returns a map that

  `:ordering` set, where the floor is 0 and nobody has bonded) a stake-weighted

  That fallback is not BFT and this fn will not let a caller pretend otherwise:
  head counting has no Sybil resistance whatsoever, since anyone can mint
  arbitrarily many did:keys for free. `:sybil-resistant? false` is the honest
