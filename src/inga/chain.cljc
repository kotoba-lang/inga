  "What inga orders: the ADVANCE of an agent's own source chain.

  ADR-2608038000 H1 states the design in one line — *inga が順序づけるのは
  transaction ではなく、agent chain head の前進である* — and then names the
  gap: `inga.consensus`'s `:inga.block/proposals` is a vector of opaque ids
  and nothing turned a committed one into state. This namespace is that
  bridge, and it is deliberately the only place where a proposal stops being
  opaque.

  ## Why this is the shape that lets Holochain and BFT meet

  Holochain's constraint is that an agent may only author its own source
  chain. BFT's contribution is a total order. Put the transaction bodies in
  the blocks and the two fight: the order has to be over things every replica
  can validate, and validating a transfer means knowing what a transfer is.
  Order the chain HEADS instead and neither side has to move — a head advance
  is `{author, seq, prev, entry}`, `entry` is an id this namespace never
  opens, and the whole of what consensus decides is *which agent moved from
  which head to which, in what order*.

  `inga.state` enforces the rest structurally: `:actor-advance` is a
  self-write op, so an advance that names someone else's address is refused
  by the same rule that refuses writing their record.

  ## The three answers, and who gives them

  | question | answered by |
  |---|---|
  | may this agent advance? | `inga.state`'s `:authority` — self-write |
  | is this the next link? | `inga.state`'s `:actor-advance` — `prev` is the committed head, `seq` is `nonce+1` |
  | is the entry itself valid? | the APPLICATION, before it votes |

  The third is not here and cannot be: an entry's validity is what an
  application means by a transaction, and a consensus layer that imports one
  application becomes that application's consensus layer.

  ## Unresolvable proposals throw, and that is the correct halt

  `decode-block` throws when `resolve-fn` cannot produce the advance a
  committed proposal names. A replica that cannot see what it is applying
  must not invent a state — it must sync. Applying \"nothing\" instead would
  be worse than stopping: it produces a root that disagrees with every
  replica that COULD see the proposal, silently.

  This is only reachable if a quorum voted for a proposal nobody can resolve,
  which is what validating BEFORE voting is for. `valid-advance?` is exported
  so the vote path and the apply path use ONE predicate rather than two that
  can drift."

(defn valid-advance?
  "Shape check for a chain advance. Not a validity check on the entry — see
  the ns docstring's third row.

  Used by the apply path here AND intended for the vote path, so a proposal
  that would halt `decode-block` is one a correct replica never voted for."

  It MUST be deterministic across replicas — two replicas that resolve one id
  differently produce different actor trees from one block, and the roots say
  so, which is the failure being made visible rather than prevented.

  second copy of it. A caller building the NEXT advance needs exactly this
