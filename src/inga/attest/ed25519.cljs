(ns inga.attest.ed25519
  "Ed25519 through WebCrypto — the only place in engi that knows what a curve
  is.

  Named under `inga.attest` rather than beside the existing `inga.crypto`
  (which is kotobase's client-side key handling) because what it implements is
  the verifier `inga.attest` takes as a parameter, and a name that says so is
  worth more than a name that groups by subject matter.

  Everything above takes verification as a parameter, for the reason that
  decision keeps earning: `kotoba-lang/ed25519` is JVM-only, and a browser
  that cannot re-verify a certificate is not a verifier. This exists so there
  is ONE implementation of the platform call rather than one per node.

  ## The witness id IS the public key

  A witness is named by its base64 raw public key. That removes the registry a
  name-to-key mapping would need, and with it the question of who may edit
  that registry — the same conclusion `torihiki.auth` reached from the other
  direction, where the key is the identity and the id is a handle for it.

  It also makes a certificate self-describing: everything needed to check it
  is inside it."
