  "A replica: the thing that actually runs consensus.

  Everything else in this repo is a correct piece of a protocol nobody had
  assembled. `inga.consensus` builds blocks, votes and certificates;
  `inga.pacemaker` decides when a view has failed; `inga.sync` decides what a
  lagging replica may believe; `inga.attest` signs and verifies; `inga.net`
  decides who to spend bandwidth on; `inga.wire` says what a message is. All
  of them are tested. **None of them had ever been composed into something
  that proposes a block, collects votes, forms a certificate, and commits.**

  That gap is not visible from a test suite. It is the same shape as a
  terminal whose client was compiled, deployed, and never referenced from the
  page: every part green, the whole thing never executed.

  ## A block's clock is logical, so the same block is the same block

  `:ts` came from the wall clock, which makes a block a function of WHEN it
  was built. A leader that restarts and proposes again for the same height,
  on the same parent, with the same transactions, produces a DIFFERENT block —
  different timestamp, different hash — and the votes for the two split. Four
  validators on Cloudflare sat at height one with three votes across three
  hashes for exactly this reason, and persistence only narrows the window
  rather than closing it: the write still has to win a race against eviction.

  So the timestamp is derived from the parent. Proposing is now a pure
  function of the chain, and a restarted leader re-proposes the byte-identical
  block. Nothing has to win a race.

  This is the rule `torihiki.state` already imposes on itself — the block
  header IS the clock and nothing below it may consult a real one — applied
  one level up, where the header is made. The cost is that time advances per
  block rather than per second, so anything measured in it (funding, timeouts
  inside the machine) counts blocks. That is a real difference and it is the
  side that can be agreed on.

  ## Committed blocks execute, which is the entire point of ordering them

  A consensus protocol that agrees on an order and applies nothing has agreed
  on nothing anybody wanted. Until this existed, `:committed` was a list of
  blocks the replicas concurred about and no replica did anything with, and
  the property being demonstrated — four processes agreeing on a sequence —
  was weaker than it looked, because agreeing on the ORDER is easy to get
  right by accident when nothing depends on the result.

  The machine is injected as `{:init-fn ... :apply-fn ... :root-fn ...}`:
  init-fn takes nothing and returns a starting state, apply-fn takes a state
  and a block and returns the next state, and root-fn takes a state and
  returns a string.

  The initial state is PRODUCED rather than handed over, because a state
  machine may own mutable structure and four replicas sharing one value is
  four replicas sharing one state. `torihiki`'s order book is a struct of
  typed arrays — its whole speed argument rests on that — so a machine map
  holding a ready-made exchange gave every replica the same book, and they
  agreed on the committed blocks while disagreeing about the resting order
  count by two hundred. A thunk makes that unrepresentable rather than
  documented. `engi` does not know what a transaction is
  and must not — that is `torihiki.state` for a trading chain and
  `engi.core` for transfers, and a consensus layer that imported either would
  be a consensus layer for exactly one application.

  Only COMMITTED blocks are applied, and exactly once each, in order. Applying
  an adopted-but-uncommitted block would be applying a block that can still be
  replaced, and undoing it afterwards is the thing the 3-chain rule exists to
  make unnecessary.

  With a machine configured, `state-root` is what a replica actually agrees to
  — and two replicas that committed the same blocks and derived different
  roots have found a determinism bug, which is the failure the root exists to
  surface and the reason it is worth computing at all.

  ## Equivocation is recorded, because it is the one crime that proves itself

  Two votes from one witness at one height for different blocks, both signed
  and both verifying, cannot both be honest. Nothing else in this protocol has
  that property: a slow replica and a censoring one look identical, a leader
  that skips its turn looks like a leader that crashed. This one is decidable
  from the two messages alone, by anybody, without trusting whoever reported
  it — which is exactly what makes it the only thing worth slashing for.

  A replica keeps the first signed vote it accepted per `[witness height]`. A
  second one for a different block is refused AND kept as evidence, in the
  shape `inga.stake/detect-equivocation` produces, so `slash` and
  `verify-equivocation-evidence` take it unchanged.

  Refusing it is not the interesting part — quorum already stops a Byzantine
  minority from certifying two blocks at one height. Keeping the proof is. An
  equivocating validator that is merely ignored pays nothing and can do it
  again next height, forever, for free.

  ## Catching up goes through `inga.sync`, which it did not

  `inga.sync` exists to decide what a lagging replica may believe from a
  stranger: that a segment attaches to a block already held, that heights are
  contiguous, that every block is justified by a certificate for its own
  parent, that the certificate carries a quorum of signatures that actually
  verify, and that the whole thing is bounded. All of it tested. None of it
  reached — `handle-sync-response` walked the blocks itself and checked only
  that each linked to the one before.

  So the third instance of the same defect: a careful namespace nothing
  called. A peer could hand over an unbounded segment whose certificates named
  witnesses who never voted, and it would be adopted as history.

  ## Views have to converge, or the safety rule deadlocks the chain

  Replicas time out independently, so their views drift — 16, 16, 21 and 51 on
  a deployed chain — and `pm/timeout-certificate` only bundles new-views that
  share a view. Once they have drifted, no certificate can form and nothing
  brings them back.

  That is not merely a liveness nuisance. Locks carry the view they were
  formed in, and `safe-to-vote?` compares them: a replica locked in view 51
  will not vote for a block justified in view 16, correctly, and the chain
  stops with three replicas holding a block two votes short of quorum.

  So a replica jumps when f+1 distinct witnesses report being at or past a
  higher view. f+1 rather than a quorum because the job is different: a quorum
  decides what is agreed, this decides what is BELIEVABLE, and f+1 contains at
  least one honest replica that really is there. One Byzantine replica
  claiming view nine thousand moves nobody.

  ## And a new-view nobody signed is worse than an unsigned vote

  A timeout certificate is folded out of the high QCs carried by new-view
  messages, and `on-timeout-certificate` feeds that QC straight into the lock.
  So an unsigned new-view is not merely a liveness nuisance: whoever can send
  quorum-many of them decides what every replica locks onto, and a lock on a
  block that never existed either stops the chain or moves it onto a fork.

  New-views are signed over the view AND the identity of the certificate they
  carry, so a genuine one cannot have its certificate swapped. The certificate
  inside is itself re-verified — a signed message asserting an unverified
  certificate would just move the forgery one level in.

  ## A vote nobody signed is a claim, not a vote

  A replica assembles certificates out of the votes it receives. So an
  unsigned vote is not a small gap: one connected peer sends
  `{witness: w2, ...}`, `{witness: w3, ...}`, `{witness: w4, ...}` and has
  manufactured a quorum by itself, without holding a single key. Certificates
  carried signatures from the start; the votes they are built out of did not,
  which made the certificate signatures decorative — an attacker fabricates
  the votes and lets the honest replica sign the certificate for it.

  `verify-fn` is injected, like every other cryptographic seam here, and when
  one is configured a vote without a verifying signature is dropped. When none
  is configured nothing is checked, which is right for replaying a history
  this replica already agreed to and wrong for anything else — so `replica`
  says so rather than defaulting quietly.

  ## Every witness id is normalised to its wire form

  `inga.wire` sends the keyword :w1 as the string w1, so a replica that
  recorded its own vote
  under the keyword and its peers' under the string counted one physical
  witness as two — and a quorum of three could be two replicas plus one of
  them twice. Every id entering this namespace goes through `wire/wire-id`,
  including the replica's own, so there is exactly one spelling of a witness.

  ## Pure, and message-driven

  `on-message` and `on-tick` take a state and return `[state' outbox]`, where
  the outbox is a vector of `{:to :all|<witness> :msg m}`. Nothing here opens
  a socket, reads a clock, or hashes anything: `hash-fn` and the signing seam
  are injected, for the same reason they are everywhere else — a browser that
  cannot import a JVM crypto library still has to be able to check a chain.

  That also makes a four-replica network an ordinary unit test with a map for
  a transport, so the properties below are asserted deterministically rather
  than observed once in a lucky run.

  ## Votes are broadcast, not sent to the leader

  Classic HotStuff routes votes to the next leader, who alone forms the
  certificate. Here every replica sees every vote and forms the certificate
  itself. It costs O(n²) messages instead of O(n), which for a validator set
  of this size is nothing, and it buys two things worth more: a replica's
  progress no longer depends on the leader being honest enough to relay a
  certificate it could have withheld, and every replica can be asked what it
  has committed without asking the leader.

  ## One vote per HEIGHT

  A replica records the heights it has voted at and never votes twice at one.
  Equivocation is the thing certificates exist to prevent, and a replica that
  can be talked into voting twice by a proposer that sends two blocks is a
  Byzantine replica written by accident.

  Per height rather than per view, which is what this tried first and is a
  bug that only a running network shows. Views advance on TIMEOUT; heights
  advance on progress. So a replica that voted at view 0 for height 1 could
  not vote for height 2, or 3, or ever again, until something timed out — and
  the thing that would have timed out was the chain it had just refused to
  extend. It stalled at height two with every replica holding enough votes to
  go on.

  The property worth having is that a replica never votes twice AT A HEIGHT,
  and that is the one stated here."

(defn- my-turn?
  "Whose turn it is, keyed by HEIGHT.

  This is the wrong key and it is the one that works today. Keyed by height, a
  dead leader holds its turn forever: the height does not advance while its
  leader is down, so the turn never moves, and four deployed validators with a
  quorum of three out of four stopped at the height the one wiped replica was
  due to lead. A protocol that tolerates one failure in four, not tolerating
  one failure in four.

  `inga.pacemaker/leader-for-view` is the right key and says so in its own
  docstring. Deploying it stopped the chain at height one instead, because
  view-keyed leadership needs the replicas to AGREE about the view, and view
  synchronisation here is a timeout certificate that forms only when enough
  replicas happen to time out into the same view. They do not, reliably; each
  ends up the leader of its own view and nobody is the leader of the chain.

  ## Re-verified 2026-08-10, and one sentence above was already wrong

  **View synchronisation IS written.** `sync-view` jumps to a higher view when
  f+1 distinct witnesses are at or past it, counted across every view at or
  above the candidate rather than only messages naming it exactly — which is
  the drift this paragraph used to say had no answer. Measured on a seven
  process devnet: after a witness departs, all six survivors sit on the SAME
  view and rotate leadership through it correctly. Views converge.

  So the remaining gap is not convergence. It is that everything around this
  function assumes the height key. Swapping the body for
  `(pm/leader-for-view (:witnesses state) (:view (:pm state)))` and changing
  nothing else takes the suite from 0 failures to **44 failures and 1 error
  across 20 tests** — including `a-block-is-proposed-voted-certified-and-
  committed`, so the chain does not reach height one, exactly as this
  paragraph warned. The cheap fix is closed off; it was tried again against
  the code as it stands today, not as it stood when this was written.

  What a real change has to answer, and this note does not: a view produces at
  most one block, so height and view have to advance together or the leader of
  a view has nothing to propose; `propose` asks `my-turn?` for the height it
  is about to build, and a view-keyed answer makes that question the wrong
  one; and `resume` restores a view from a snapshot, so a restarted replica
  would re-enter a view whose leader has moved on.

  ## The constraint both experiments found: leadership must be keyed by state
  ## every replica agrees on EXACTLY, not eventually

  A second attempt keyed leadership by `(+ h view)` — the classic round
  number, and an apparently safe one because `sync-view` makes the view
  converge and the height is the tip. It is better and still wrong:
  **21 failures and 1 error**, with the chain again not reaching height one.

  The reason is the difference between the two quantities. **Height is agreed
  exactly**: it is read off a committed chain every replica holds the same
  prefix of. **The view is agreed eventually**: `sync-view` pulls drifted
  replicas up to it, `on-progress` bumps it when a QC arrives, and between
  those moments two correct replicas can hold different views for perfectly
  legitimate reasons. Leadership computed from eventually-agreed state means
  two replicas disagree about who may propose — so either nobody proposes or
  two do, and both are indistinguishable from the stall this was meant to fix.

  So a real fix cannot read the round out of local pacemaker state at all. The
  round has to become part of what the quorum certifies — carried in the block
  and in the QC, so that agreeing on the chain IS agreeing on the round —
  which is a wire-format change and a `resume` change, not a change to this
  function.

  So: height, with a stated fault-tolerance gap, over view with a measured
  liveness failure. Choosing the running one is not the same as thinking it is
  correct — and `inga.departure-test/stalls-when-the-height-leader-departs`
  now pins the gap as an executable fact rather than a paragraph."

  Votes are grouped by BLOCK HASH, and deliberately not by [view block-hash].

  Keying by view as well was the first thing this got wrong, and it does not
  show up until the network is real. The worry it was written for — two views
  certifying blocks at the same height — is answered by the hash itself: the
  hash covers the height, parent, proposals, proposer and timestamp, so two
  views cannot produce one hash, and every vote carrying a given hash is a
  vote for the same decision by construction.

  What keying by view actually did was split those votes by the VOTER's local
  view. Replicas time out at slightly different moments, so their views drift
  apart by one, and then three votes for the same block sit in three different
  buckets and quorum is never reached by anyone. The chain stalled at height
  two while every replica held enough votes to certify it.

  Nothing in the deterministic test could see this: with no timeouts firing,
  every replica stayed in view 0 and the two keyings are the same key.

  The certificate takes the HIGHEST view among its votes, which is what the
  pacemaker orders locks by — taking the lowest would let a certificate formed
  late lose to one formed earlier for a block it supersedes.

  A replica folds its OWN vote through here too. Recording only what arrives
  over the network would mean every replica was one vote short of what it
  actually knows, and with a four-witness set that is the difference between
  reaching quorum and never reaching it — a transport detail silently setting

  "Who a vote for `block` is addressed to.

  `:broadcast` (default) sends it to everyone: every replica folds votes into
  certificates itself, which is why `/head` can report a `fold-vote` origin
  for its tip certificate.

  `:leader` sends it to the replica that will build on the block — the leader
  of the next round — which is what HotStuff does and is n times fewer
  messages per round. It is sound because the certificate only has to exist
  where it is USED: the next proposer needs it to justify its block, and
  everyone else receives it inside that proposal.

  What it costs is the thing broadcast was quietly buying: a replica that is
  not the next leader stops being able to certify the tip on its own, so a
  proposer that misses the votes has to ask for them rather than having heard
  them already.

  ## Measured, and the saving does not pay for that cost

  `script/network.cljs`, NET_DELAY=20, real sockets:

      n=4   broadcast  126 heights   4425 msgs in
            leader     127           4405

      n=7   broadcast  100 heights   7471 msgs in
            leader      94           7333

  **Votes are not what this transport spends its messages on.** Cutting them
  to one recipient moved the count by half a percent, and at seven witnesses
  the round trip a proposer now needs to fetch the votes it did not hear cost
  more than the messages saved — six fewer heights in the same wall clock.

  So the default stays `:broadcast`. This is kept, opt-in, because the
  measurement is worth being able to repeat: the balance could turn at a
  larger validator set, and the way to find out is to run it rather than to
  reason about message counts."

(defn- handle-sync-request
  "Answer with at most `:max-batch` blocks.

  Unclamped, `{from 1, to 999999}` makes every replica serialise its whole
  chain — one small message costing the network everything it holds, from a
  peer that has to be neither a witness nor even correct. `inga.sync/request`
  already asks in windows for the replica's own sake; this is the same bound
  applied where it is a defence rather than a convenience.

  ## A host that uses `resume` MUST answer this itself

  This serves `(:chain state)` — what the replica holds in MEMORY. `resume`
  bounds that chain to `resume-tail` blocks, so **a replica booted from a
  snapshot can serve almost nothing**, and it answers a request for old blocks
  with an empty segment rather than with an error.

  ## The answer is addressed to whoever asked

  Broadcasting it looks harmless — everybody drops what does not attach — but
  a replica far behind receives mostly ANSWERS TO OTHER REPLICAS' QUESTIONS,
  each starting at a height it cannot reach, and refuses them one after
  another. Measured on the devnet: a validator at height 0 was offered a
  segment beginning at 1276, which was the range a caught-up peer had asked
  about, and reported `:does-not-attach` — a correct refusal of an answer
  that was never meant for it. `:witness` is what makes the reply go back.

  A request without a witness still gets a broadcast answer, because both
  versions of a node run side by side across a deploy and refusing the older
  form would make the upgrade itself the outage.

  That combination is silent and it deadlocks a network. Measured on a
  deployed devnet: a replica reset to genesis sent 49 sync requests, its peers
  returned 115 sync responses, and it stayed at height 0 — every response was
  empty, and nothing anywhere said so. **A replica that cannot serve history
  cannot heal its peers**, and the bounded resume that makes restarts cheap is
  exactly what takes that away.

  The blocks are not lost; they are in whatever durable store the host wrote
  them to. But consensus here is a pure library and cannot read it. So a host
  that calls `resume` has to intercept `:sync-request` before `on-message`
  sees it and answer from storage — `torihiki-node`'s validator does this in
  `answerSyncRequests`. A host that keeps the whole chain in memory can leave
  this alone."

  "Vote for the tip when this replica has not voted at that height.

  Catching up adopts blocks without voting for them, and a block everybody
  adopted and nobody voted for can never be certified — so the chain freezes
  at exactly the height the replicas synced to. Four deployed validators sat
  there with thousands of proposals received, a thousand sync-responses each,
  and ZERO votes recorded for the tip: `blocked-by: no certificate for the
  tip` on all four at once.

  Voting for it is safe and is what a caught-up replica is for. `inga.sync`
  already refused the segment unless every block in it carried a certificate
  for its own parent with a quorum of verifying signatures — a block that
  arrived that way has been agreed by more replicas than this one has heard
  from directly.

  ## Having voted at this height is not a reason to stay silent

  `replay` records every height it folds as voted — correctly, because those
  are blocks this replica adopted and voted for the first time round. But a
  replica that REPLAYS to its tip holds no certificate for that tip:
  `replay` recovers a certificate only from a block's `:justify`, and the
  certificate for the tip travels in the block AFTER it, which does not exist
  yet. So the tip is uncertified, the leader cannot propose on it, and this
  function — written for exactly that situation — refused to vote because
  `voted?` said yes.

  Measured on the deployed devnet: all four replicas at height 282, view 267,
  `blocked-by: no certificate for the tip`, `votes-for-tip: 0`, and
  `sent-types {new-view 29, sync-response 87}`. Not one vote, forever.

  Re-casting is safe for the same reason `handle-proposal` already re-casts:
  `voted?` says we voted at this HEIGHT, and **a replica's chain IS what it
  voted for**, so a vote for our own tip is the same vote we already cast.
  This function never votes for anything except `(tip state)`, so nothing
  else at that height can be voted for by accident."

(defn- catch-up-view
  "Come back at the view the chain says the network had reached.

  `replay` restores the chain, the certificates and the voted heights, and
  left the VIEW at whatever a fresh pacemaker starts with. A certificate
  inside a block only says which view certified the block's PARENT, and
  `pm/on-qc` does not move the view at all — so a replica came back behind the
  round its own tip was proposed in.

  Leadership rotates by round. Being behind it is not a small lag: the round
  entitled to extend the tip is `(inc (round tip))`, one replica leads it, and
  every other replica answers `not-my-round` and waits. If the one that leads
  it is also the one that is behind, nobody proposes at all.

  Measured on the deployed v2 after a restart, with `propose` finally saying
  why it declined:

    w1  not-my-round               height 6800  round 7530  leads w3  view 6703
    w2  not-my-round               height 6800  round 7530  leads w3  view 6703
    w3  no-certificate-for-the-tip height 6794  round 6795  leads w4  view 6703

  Every replica agreed the next round was 7530 and that w3 led it; every
  replica was eight hundred views short of it; and w3, the one that had to
  propose, was six blocks behind. The chain sat there. `/reset` cleared it
  because reset puts the rounds back to zero along with everything else —
  which is why the recovery looked like magic and was really just the view and
  the rounds agreeing again.

  A block's round is evidence the same way a certificate is: the replica
  adopted and voted for that block, so a quorum was at that view. Raising to
  it is the same forward jump `pm/on-timeout-certificate` makes, from a
  different piece of evidence."

(defn replay
  "Adopt blocks this replica already accepted, without re-verifying them.

  A replica that keeps its state in memory and is restarted comes back at
  genesis, and a leader that comes back at genesis proposes a FRESH block for
  a height it already proposed. Every restart adds another incompatible
  candidate, no two votes are for the same decision, and quorum can never
  form. Four validators on Cloudflare did exactly that: three votes, three
  block hashes, one height. In one process it cannot happen because nothing
  restarts, which is why the harness ran to a hundred blocks while the
  deployment could not pass one.

  So a deployment persists what it adopted and replays it here. Not
  re-verified, for the same reason `torihiki.state/apply-block` has a replay
  mode and `inga.sync` takes its verifier as an option: re-checking is
  re-litigating a decision this replica already made and recorded.

  Three things are restored and each of them matters:

  - the chain and the machine, by folding — that is what `extend-chain` does
  - the certificates, so a leader can propose on the tip again instead of
    sitting on a chain it cannot extend
  - **the heights this replica has already voted at.** Without that, a
    restart votes a second time at a height it already voted at, which is

  "The replica as plain data, bounded, for storage.

  ## What it drops, and why that is safe

  `replay` restores `:voted` by folding every block. A bounded snapshot cannot
  — that is the whole point — so it leaves a WATERMARK instead: `:voted-below`
  = the tip height. `voted?` then refuses at every height at or under it,
  which refuses at least as much as the folded set did. Refusing more costs a
  vote at a height already decided; refusing less is equivocation.

  `:votes`, `:new-views` and `:first-vote` are dropped outright. They are
  per-view working state, and the one place `:votes` is load-bearing across a
  restart — re-sending this replica's own vote when a proposal for an
  already-voted height arrives again — degrades to sending nothing, which is
  what a replica that has genuinely never seen the block would do anyway.
  **Dropping `:first-vote` also drops the equivocation evidence this replica
  had collected about others below the tail**, which is a real loss and is
  stated rather than hidden: evidence already broadcast is held by peers, and
  evidence not yet broadcast is gone.

  The injected seams (`:hash-fn`, `:sign-fn`, `:verify-fn`, `:machine`) are
  not here because they are functions. `resume` takes the same options map
  `replica` does and puts them back.

  `:machine-state` IS here. A replica that resumed with a fresh machine would
  agree on the order and disagree on the result, which is the failure that is
  hardest to see: every block certifies, every root differs."
