  "What replicas say to each other, as data a transport can carry.

  `inga.pacemaker` decides what to do and `inga.sync` decides what may be
  believed. Neither can say anything, because consensus messages had no
  encoding. This is that encoding, and deliberately nothing else: no sockets,
  no framing, no reconnect policy. A driver turns these maps into bytes.

  ## Decoding is total

  A replica takes messages from peers, and a peer may be Byzantine, broken, or
  a different version. `decode` therefore NEVER THROWS: it returns either a
  message or a rejection reason. A codec that throws on malformed input hands
  every peer a way to kill the replica by sending nonsense, which is a cheaper
  attack than anything the consensus rules defend against.

  This is the same rule `torihiki.api` arrived at for transactions, for the
  same reason and after the same bug.

  ## The wire is strings, and that is where a signature can be lost

  JSON has no keywords, so `:inga.block/height` travels as `\"height\"`. The
  conversion has to happen at a stated point, because anything that hashes or
  signs a message must hash the same representation on both sides. torihiki
  lost a whole afternoon to normalising AFTER computing a signing payload:
  every signature failed for a reason that looked like cryptography and was
  not. Here the rule is that `decode` produces the internal shape and nothing
  downstream re-encodes.

  ## Bounds are part of the protocol

  Every message carries a size limit, because a peer that sends an enormous
  but well-formed message needs no invalid data to exhaust a replica. This is
  the same argument `inga.sync` makes for bounding a segment.")

  `(str :w1)` is `\":w1\"`, so a keyword witness comes back from the wire as a
  DIFFERENT identifier than it left as — and `inga.consensus/qc` counts
  distinct witnesses, so a certificate assembled from wire messages and one
  assembled locally would disagree about who signed it.

  Dropping the leading colon rather than calling `name` keeps a namespaced
  keyword whole: `name` would turn `:org/w1` and `:other/w1` into the same
  string, which is worse than the bug this replaces.

  Public because a replica has to normalise its own ids the same way. This
  docstring already named the failure — 'a certificate assembled from wire
  messages and one assembled locally would disagree about who signed it' —
  and that is exactly what happened the first time four replicas were run
  over real sockets: a replica recorded its own vote under ':w1' and its
  peers' under 'w1', so one physical witness counted as two and a quorum of
  three could be two replicas. Encoding correctly is only half of it; the

  exactly the reason `wire-id` exists: the configured set is held as `:w1`
  while a certificate that crossed the wire names `\"w1\"`, so a raw set
  rejects every genuine witness. `inga.sync` already recorded that failure
  once — a proposer check compared with `str`, refused EVERY segment
  including the honest ones, and looked like a successful fix because the
  thing being measured was a forgery no longer getting in.

  A check that rejects everything and a check that rejects the right thing
  are indistinguishable from the attacker's side. Normalising here is what
