  "F3 — the power table as COMMITTED STATE, and a `:storage` role.

  ## What changes, and what deliberately does not

  `inga.stake` (which arrived here from engi in the same extraction) already
  implements permissionless admission by external
  collateral, stake-weighted quorum, equivocation-only slashing, and a
  role-tagged single bond market (`:ordering` for block-consensus voting,
  `:recompute` for proof-of-compute sampling). None of that economics is
  reimplemented here, and this namespace must not grow a second copy of it —
  superproject ADR-2608031200 named that failure mode the same week.

  The one thing `inga.stake` cannot do by itself is the thing F3 is about:
  **it is HANDED the bond map from outside.** `{witness-did -> {:amount
  :roles}}` arrives already assembled, so who is a witness is decided
  somewhere the consensus does not order. Two replicas reading the escrow at
  slightly different moments have different validator sets, and a validator
  set is not a thing peers may disagree about — it is what quorum is counted
  against.

  Filecoin's Storage Power Consensus puts the power table IN chain state, so
  a change in power is ordered by the same consensus that orders everything
  else. This namespace is that: a table plus a transition function the
  machine applies, so the table at height h is a function of the committed
  prefix and nothing else.

  ## `:storage` — the new role

  SPC's deeper idea is that the Sybil-resistant resource should be the useful
  work the network exists to do (storage, proved). For this stack that work
  is retaining and serving datom blocks, so `:storage` joins the existing
  role set on the existing market — a role added to one rulebook, not a
  second economy.

  What this does NOT do: replace external collateral. `inga.stake`'s reason
  for bonding USDC rather than EN holds unchanged (EN nets to zero across all
  agents, so bonding it disincentivises nothing), and ADR-2608038000 F3 says
  so explicitly. And `:storage` power here is credited by attested retrieval
  sampling — the shape `:recompute` already uses — **not** by PoRep/PoSt.
  This library does not implement a storage proof and no deployment using it
  may claim Filecoin-equivalent storage guarantees."

  evidence verifies does NOT: every replica folds the same committed bytes

  deterministic.

  And throwing here would hand any proposer a halt: put one bogus `:slash` in
  a block and every replica dies applying it. A slash is the one event ANYONE
  may submit ABOUT ANYONE — it is adversarial input by construction, and
