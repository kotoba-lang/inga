  "F2 — metered execution, where running out is a STATE TRANSITION and not an
  exception.

  ## The bug class this closes

  A consensus machine seam that takes an arbitrary `apply-fn` has no bound on
  the work a block can cause and no guarantee two replicas agree on what that
  work was. engi hit the second half of this for real (its ADR-2608022600): a
  machine map holding a ready-made order book handed every replica the same
  mutable structure, and four replicas that agreed on 123 committed blocks
  disagreed by 200 resting orders. That was found by a test. The class it
  belongs to is not.

  Filecoin's FVM answers this by making actor code WASM with every operation
  metered by gas, so determinism is a property of the VM rather than of each
  actor's care. Kotoba already has the same primitive: the compiler's native
  backends (`backend/x86_64.cljc`, `backend/aarch64.cljc`) implement fuel
  accounting, and capabilities are deny-by-default (superproject
  ADR-2607198300, ADR-2608010930 D4).

  ## The one rule that makes metering safe for consensus

  **Exhaustion must be a value in the state, never a thrown exception.**

  A replica that throws has left the protocol: it produces no state and no
  root, while its peers produce both. So `apply-metered` never throws on
  running out — it stops, records where it stopped, and that record is part
  of the state the root commits to. Two replicas that exhaust at the same op
  agree; a replica that somehow exhausts elsewhere produces a DIFFERENT root
  and is visibly wrong, which is the whole point of committing to a root.

  Determinism here depends on exactly three things — the budget, the cost
  function, and the order of ops — and on nothing else. No clock, no
  allocation counting, no host measurement. Anything that a second
  implementation could reasonably compute differently is not allowed to
  influence the result.

  ## What this namespace is NOT

  It is not a `.kotoba` machine yet. ADR-2608038000 F2's endpoint is the
  machine body compiled to fuel-metered Kotoba; today the compiler's
  capability kits are `:reference :implemented` with `:wasm-aot`/`:native-aot`
  pending, and there is no fs/process capability or Kotoba script host to run
  a build from. So this establishes the metering CONTRACT and the determinism
  property at the seam, which is what consensus actually needs, and the
  remaining step is named rather than implied.")

  `step` is `(fn [state op] -> state)`. It is called ONLY for ops that were
  paid for, so a caller cannot accidentally observe a half-charged effect.

  Charging BEFORE the op, and refusing an op whose cost does not fit, is what
  keeps the boundary crisp: `spent` never exceeds `budget`, so `budget` is a
  real ceiling rather than an approximate one. The alternative — run, then
  charge, then notice — lets one expensive op overrun by an unbounded amount,
  and 'unbounded' is not a quantity two replicas can agree on."
