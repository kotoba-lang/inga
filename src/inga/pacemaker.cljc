  "View change: how a chained-HotStuff replica makes progress when a leader
  does not.

  `inga.consensus` owns the SAFETY rules — quorum arithmetic, the shape of a
  quorum certificate, the three-chain commit rule. Those say what may never
  happen. They say nothing about what must eventually happen, and a protocol
  with only safety rules has a trivial implementation: never propose anything.

  This namespace is the other half, and it is the half that kills home-grown
  BFT. Safety is a handful of comparisons that are easy to get right and easy
  to test. Liveness is a timeout, a certificate, a lock, and an exponential
  backoff, interacting — and the failure mode is not a crash but a chain that
  stops, sometimes only under a partition that lasts long enough.

  ## The lock is the whole safety argument across a view change

  A replica keeps a LOCKED QC: the certificate of the block it has seen two
  consecutive certified descendants of. Having voted to commit on that basis,
  it must not later vote for a branch that excludes it.

  So the vote rule has two clauses, and both are needed:

  - SAFETY: vote for a block that extends the locked QC.
  - LIVENESS: also vote when the block's justification is from a LATER view
    than the lock.

  Without the first, a view change lets a new leader propose a branch that
  drops an already-committed block — two conflicting commits, which is exactly
  the thing the whole protocol exists to prevent. Without the second, a replica
  that locked on a branch which then lost can never vote again, and the chain
  halts with every replica individually safe and collectively stuck.

  The second clause is safe because a QC from a later view proves that a
  quorum — which intersects the quorum that formed the lock in at least one
  honest replica — has already moved on.

  ## Timeouts must grow

  A fixed timeout under a partition produces a view change per timeout
  forever: every view times out, nobody ever assembles a proposal, and the
  chain makes no progress while looking busy. Doubling means the views
  eventually become longer than the message delay, and the chain resumes on
  its own once the network does.

  ## Everything here is a pure function of data

  No clock, no sockets, no timers. `now` is passed in. That is what lets an
  entire n-replica view change, including a partition and its healing, be
  simulated as a value in a test."
