  "Signatures on certificates — what makes a quorum a quorum rather than a
  list of names.

  `inga.consensus/qc` counts DISTINCT WITNESSES and its docstring says votes
  arrive 'already signature-verified by the caller'. That contract holds where
  a replica collects votes it received itself. It is not honoured anywhere in
  the sync path, and cannot be: a certificate inside a block from a stranger
  was never seen by this replica as votes at all.

  So until this namespace existed, `inga.sync` accepted any segment whose
  certificates NAMED quorum-many witnesses. A peer could list three witnesses
  who never voted and hand over a fabricated history that passed every check.
  The commit rule was sound and the thing it was checking was not.

  ## Aggregation, and what this is not

  This is aggregation by CONCATENATION: a certificate carries one signature
  per witness. Real aggregation — BLS, one signature regardless of quorum size
  — needs a pairing-friendly curve, and WebCrypto does not have one. Adding a
  curve implementation would put the most security-critical arithmetic in the
  system into hand-written code, in a project whose whole transport argument
  (ADR-2608021030) was that it must run wherever the platform already provides
  what it needs.

  The cost is stated rather than hidden: certificate size grows linearly with
  the validator set, so at 100 validators a certificate carries 100 signatures.
  That is a bandwidth problem at a scale this system is nowhere near, and it is
  a bandwidth problem rather than a correctness one. When it matters, the fix
  is a curve, not a shortcut.

  ## The payload is domain-separated

  A vote signature covers the chain id, the view, the height, the block hash
  and the witness. Each is load-bearing for the same reasons `torihiki.auth`
  gives: without the chain id a testnet signature authorises a mainnet vote;
  without the view a signature from one view certifies another; without the
  witness a signature can be replayed as somebody else's."

  load-bearing part of the message, since it is how the next leader learns
  what it must extend and what every replica will lock onto.

  Maps rather than vectors because a certificate's witnesses are a SET — a
  vector would impose an order that two replicas could disagree about, and
  ordering is exactly what this project has had to fix three times.

  The views are the part that was missing. `vote-payload` covers the view, so
  a vote signed in view 16 and a vote signed in view 51 have different
  payloads — and a certificate that remembers only one view can reconstruct
  only one of them. Every other signature then fails to verify, the
  certificate is refused `:below-quorum`, and a replica that needed the block
  is refused by the check that exists to let it in.

  It cannot be avoided by making the votes agree on a view: replicas time out
  independently, so votes for one block genuinely are cast in different
  views. The certificate has to remember which."
